### Deployment Guide

Ensuring that our Eatery Management System (EMS) extends a seamless installation and deployment experience, we leverage Docker containers to encapsulate both the Flask-App (Backend) and React-App (Frontend). Adhering to the following step-wise guide will facilitate an effortless setup and initiation of our system.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and configured. If not, kindly adhere to the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Project files, including Docker files and `docker-compose.yml`, downloaded to your system.

#### Step 1: Creating Docker Images

1. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

   - Open your terminal/command prompt.
   - Change to the root directory of the project using `cd [path_to_project_folder]`.

2. **Build Docker Images:**

   - In the terminal, execute the following command:

     ```
     Copy code
     docker-compose build
     ```

   - This may require 5-6 minutes, as it generates Docker images in alignment with the `docker-compose.yml` file.

#### Step 2: Launching Docker Containers

1. Initiate Docker Containers:

   - Execute the following command in the terminal:

     ```
     Copy code
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

   - This triggers the Docker containers utilizing the previously created images.

2. Port Information:

   - Backend (Flask-App) is accessible on: `localhost:8081`.
   - Frontend (React-App) is accessible on: `localhost:80`.

#### Step 3: Accessing the EMS Website

1. Website Access:

   - Launch Google Chrome or your preferred web browser.

   - In the address bar, input:

     ```
     makefileCopy code
     localhost:80
     ```

   - Press Enter to access the EMS website and explore its functionalities.

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure all Docker containers are running successfully by utilizing:

  ```
  Copy code
  docker-compose ps
  ```

- To halt and remove all containers, networks, and volumes defined in the 

  ```
  docker-compose.yml
  ```

   file, use:

  ```
  Copy code
  docker-compose down
  ```

- Should you encounter any issues during installation or deployment, please consult the project documentation or reach out through our support channels.

### Conclusion

The aforesaid guide outlines the elementary steps towards effectively installing and deploying the Eathub EMS in a Docker environment, thereby promising a streamlined, replicable, and encapsulated setup, primed for both development and production scenarios. As you engage with Eathub, we invite you to explore the various functionalities and features embedded within, each meticulously designed to enhance and elevate the eateries management and customer dining experience.
